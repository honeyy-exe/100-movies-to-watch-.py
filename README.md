# 🎬 100 Movies To Watch - Web Scraper  

Just pushing one of my old **fun Python projects** here.   

This is a **tiny web scraping script** that grabs the **Top 100 Movies To Watch** from Empire Online (archived version) using **BeautifulSoup**, reverses the list (so it’s 1 → 100), and saves it into a neat little `movies.txt` file.  

---

## 🛠 What’s inside?  

- `requests` → to fetch the webpage  
- `BeautifulSoup` → to parse and extract movie titles  
- a few lines of Python magic → to reverse & save them

## 🚀 How to run  

1️⃣ Clone this repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/100-movies-to-watch.git
cd 100-movies-to-watch
